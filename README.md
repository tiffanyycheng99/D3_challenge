## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! This project is an exciting investigation into the correlation between health risks and state demographics utilizing visualizations created by D3 javascript library and information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We analyze differing trends shaping people's lives, as well as create charts, graphs, and interactive elements to provide unique insight that simple scatterplots cannot so easily portray.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Visualization

The  visualization, which is hosted on index.html, is a scatter plot between two dynamically-selected variables of different health risks and demographics. Labels on both axes may be selected to decide which data to display, with the plot animating the transitions of the points upon selection. Hovering over the different data points will reveal a tool-tip element that will provide exact information of the specific State and its' health risk and demographic statitstic. Additionally, a brief analysis highlights the key trends observed from the visualization and possible explanations that can be further studied.
